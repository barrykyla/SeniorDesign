The Birds and the Bees
***
For this project I was inspired by my previous works with triangulation and how triangle could interact in a space. I decided
that I had wanted to do some work with cacti or succulents, but other than that no clear plan was in sight. I looked into many
different ways to go about solving these seemingly unanswerable questions. When the inverting of my contour shapes and 
triangles had finally meshed it was done, and I could see the end. I decided it was time to take the photos and edit them in 
photoshop, so this project would be authentically mine. 

There were many challenges that faced me during this final and at times I honestly felt like it was not going to get done. I
did not anticipate for this project to be as difficult as it was,but am happy for the challenge.
