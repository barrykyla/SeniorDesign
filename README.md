You made it. Here in this repository I go indepth into my process for creating this project. It was not easy and did not start out as what it has now become. Read below to find out its origins and to find out more about why this project means so much to me. Don't forget to download the extension yourself to try out on your own browser!

# Inspiration: Where it all began:

Going into senior design I knew that I would need to come up with a project that was not only going to be visually exciting and interesting but something that was also of strong importance to myself. After some deep soul searching, I came to the realization of how much we are influenced by our everyday algorithm. They are literally everywhere and there is no escaping them. It made me wonder how much data is tracked on us, are there biases in these very mechanical like intangible ideas, and what exactly makes these ideas into a reality that is influencing our social culture every day? With these questions in mind I went searching and I learned more about big data and algorithms than I could have even imagined. 

Algorithms are man-made and they do have biases within, how impactful where these biases? No one could really guess because each algorithm is made differently by different people or companies so there is no blanket statement in regard to that. What I did find intriguing was how little and vague knowledge the general public had. I could not believe that most people did not even realize that these inhuman things were doing incredibly crazy influences on our very human interactions.
